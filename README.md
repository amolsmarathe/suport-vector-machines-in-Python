# Suport-vector-machines-algorithm-in-pure-Python
### This is to demonstrate how support vector machines algorithm can be developed in pure python WITHOUT using Scikit learn library. It will help to understand the fundamentals of mathematics behind support vector machines of machine learning

### It covers following topics:
- Tests on dummy data
- Support vector machine algorithm in python
- Build the model by instantiating the class
- Train the model
- Predict and visualize the results
